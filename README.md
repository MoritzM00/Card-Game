# Card game in Java


#### Disclaimer
This was a final assignment of my first computer science class in university.
To be able to test this program, it was necessary to exclude any actions that cannot
be predicted by tests. Therefore, this is not really a practical game, but rather a project, that
focuses on object-orientated modelling.

The `edu.kit.informatik` package can be ignored.


#### Instructions
 - Clone the repository and setup a project.
 - In `src.view.main.java` run `main()` to execute the program.
 
 
#### Command Line: Available commands

   - x: 4, 6 or 8
   - rolled number: the number you want to be rolled
 - `draw` 
   - draws a card
 - `build <buildable object>`
   - builds the specified object if possible
 - `build?`
   - shows all objects that can be built with the current amount of resources
 - `list-buildings`
   - shows all already built objects
 - `list-resources`
